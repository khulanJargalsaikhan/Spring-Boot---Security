EXERCISE 4.03
Create an application with 3 pages: a course page, a teacher page and a student page. 
Also create 3 users: one with ADMIN role, one with USER role and one with both. 
Finally, set the permissions on your security so that only people 
with the admin role can see the teacher page and only people 
with the user role can see the student page.
